= SignGenerator

Program to make text strings into 3d shapes e.g., signs.

Project started with a Claude Code prompt (groan).
UI mostly redone by a human.

== Usage & Caveats

Just run it. Either type your sign text into the text box,
or, use File->Load to load the sign text from a ".txt" file.

Note: quite a few fonts have issues with the rendering code.
Trial and error will be your friend.

== Lots more to do:

* Use Notification pattern to keep things up to date
* Then can update display info panel when needed.
* Move font selection to an Edit menu item, not button?
* Font selection: set from existing before showing dialog.
* Load/save: Add "Saved" popup to be consistent.
* Settings: Defult load/save directory (~/signs)
* Control for left-align, Center, right-align
* Optional border
* Place logos?
