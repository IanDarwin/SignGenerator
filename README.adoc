= SignGenerator

Program to make text strings into 3d shapes e.g., signs.

Project started with a Claude Code prompt (groan).
Lots of other work added.

Lots more to do:

	Change font selection to an Edit menu item, not button?
    Load/save: save vs save as, load to restore both fonts.
	Settings for padding?
	Centering, right-align?
	Place logos?
