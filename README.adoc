= text3d

An attempt at making text strings into 3d shapes e.g., signs.

Project started with a Claude Code prompt (groan).
Lots of other work added.

Lots more to do:

	Canonical menu system (file, edit, etc)
	Make the text entry widget into a preview (still at 12pt).
	Handle bold/italic better?
	Settings for padding.
